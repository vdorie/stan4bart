/**
 * @brief An accumulator estimating discounted means and variances online.
 *
 * The `observe()` method receives vector value updates and maintains a
 * running estimate of discounted means and variances.  Historical counts
 * are discounted by the multiplying by the discount factor before each
 * new observation is added (with a count of one).  1 does no discounting
 * and 0 completely forgets the past.
 *
 * The implementation uses a weighted variant of Welford's algorithm that
 * discounts past observations.  It requires a constant memory of size
 * proportional to the dimensionality of the observed vectors (i.e.,
 * O(`dim`)).  Each of its methods runs in time proportional to the size
 * of the update vectors (i.e., O(`dim`)).  Arithmetic is stable
 * following the original Welford accumulator, to which it reduces
 * when `discount_factor = 1`.
 *
 * After initialization and updating with `N` vectors
 * `y[0], ..., y[N - 1]`, the weight for vector `y[n]` is
 * ```
 * weight[n] = discount_factor^(N - n - 1).
 * ```
 *
 * The discounted mean is calculated in the usual way for weighted
 * averages,
 * ```
 * mean = sum(y .* weight) / sum(weight),
 * ```
 * where `.*` is elementwise product.
 *
 *
 * The discounted mean is then used to estimate the discounted variance,
 *
 * ```
 * var = sum(weight .* (y - mean)^2) / sum(weight).
 * ```
